MOOTOOLS FLOT
=============

![Screenshot](http://cl.ly/59VB/Screen_shot_2011-03-10_at_10.59.32_AM.png)

This is a direct port of flot from jquery to mootools (+ a few plugins)...

Everything is as originally wrote in v 0.6 (execept now runs on mootools).

Documentation can be found here [http://flot.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/API.txt](http://flot.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/API.txt)

Use at your own RISK. ;) Flot is still teh jank + and i did this port at like 3 am.

OH CRAP... ONE MORE THING
=========================

Instead of overloading the dollar (like in jquery), i put flot on a flot namespace...

    // So this...

    $.plot({...});
   
    // Becomes

    flot.plot({...});
