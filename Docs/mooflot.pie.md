flot - Pie chart plugin
==============

Fork of the Flot pie plugin found here: https://github.com/flot/flot/blob/master/jquery.flot.pie.js

**jsFiddle example:** http://jsfiddle.net/238XE/


###The plugin supports these options:

	series: {
		pie: {
			show: true/false
			radius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize, or a specified pixel length, or 'auto'
			innerRadius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize or a specified pixel length, for creating a donut effect
			startAngle: 0-2 factor of PI used for starting angle (in radians) i.e 3/2 starts at the top, 0 and 2 have the same result
			tilt: 0-1 for percentage to tilt the pie, where 1 is no tilt, and 0 is completely flat (nothing will show)
			offset: {
				top: integer value to move the pie up or down
				left: integer value to move the pie left or right, or 'auto'
			},
			stroke: {
				color: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#FFF')
				width: integer pixel width of the stroke
			},
			label: {
				show: true/false, or 'auto'
				formatter:  a user-defined function that modifies the text/style of the label text
				radius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize, or a specified pixel length
				background: {
					color: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#000')
					opacity: 0-1
				},
				threshold: 0-1 for the percentage value at which to hide labels (if they're too small)
			},
			combine: {
				threshold: 0-1 for the percentage value at which to combine slices (if they're too small)
				color: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#CCC'), if null, the plugin will automatically use the color of the first slice to be combined
				label: any text value of what the combined slice should be labeled
			}
			highlight: {
				opacity: 0-1
			}
		}
	}
